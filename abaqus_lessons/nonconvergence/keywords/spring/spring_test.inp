** The first data line for a SPRINGA element is blank

** Spring is initially unstretched and carries no force: u_x=0.0 f=0
** The initial spring stiffness, K, is 100.
** Between u_x=1.0 and u_x=2.0, K=50.   At u_x(1.0) f=100. At u_x(2.0) f=150
** Between u_x=2.0 and u_x=3.0, K=25.   At u_x(3.0) f=175.
** Between u_x=3.0 and u_x=4.0, K=12.5  At u_x(4.0) f=187.5
** Between u_x=4.0 and u_x=5.0, K=6.25  At u_x(5.0) f=193.75
** Between u_x=5.0 and u_x=6.0, K=3.125 At u_x(6.0) f=196.875

** Define the correct date for the *SPRING option.
** Remember the data is in the form of force in the spring (f), u_x (stretch of spring)

** Apply 190 units of force to the free end of the spring
** How far should the spring stretch.  Will the response be linear?
