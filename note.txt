Turn on NlGeom 

Then, switch to second elastic case and fix it. 

plane strain conditions => we have 3 principal stress and strain, 
and 1 shear stress and strain

enHill+MWB (implicit manner) model show newtop raphson to PEEQ and dPEEQ

Note: from professor Yoon

Point out the problems in the current literature model, and tell the novelty (why choose this model)

Justify the use of Machine Learning model when we have a solid mechanic model?

Use the original source sequence (force)
