 AVERAGE HEAT FLUX                   0.00       TIME AVG. HEAT FLUX   1.000E-02
 ALL HEAT FLUX RESIDUALS ARE ZERO
 ALL TEMP.    INCREMENTS ARE ZERO
 ALL CORRECTION TO TEMP.    ARE ZERO
          THERE IS ZERO HEAT FLUX EVERYWHERE

 MAXIMUM NON-PRESCRIBED INCREMENT IN TEMPERATURE IS    0.00    

 ITERATION SUMMARY FOR THE INCREMENT:   4 TOTAL ITERATIONS, OF WHICH
   0 ARE SEVERE DISCONTINUITY ITERATIONS AND  4 ARE EQUILIBRIUM ITERATIONS.

 TIME INCREMENT COMPLETED   10.0    ,  FRACTION OF STEP COMPLETED   1.00    
 STEP TIME COMPLETED       1.000E+03,  TOTAL TIME COMPLETED        1.000E+03
