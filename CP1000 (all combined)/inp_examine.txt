TYPE: Set this parameter equal to the element type key used to identify this element on 
      the *ELEMENT option. The format of this type key must be Un, where n is a positive integer
      less than 10000. To use this element type, set TYPE=Un on the *ELEMENT option.
NODES: Set this parameter equal to the number of nodes associated with an element of this type.
PROPERTIES: Set this parameter equal to the number of real (floating point) property values 
            needed as data in user subroutine UEL to define such an element. 
            The default is PROPERTIES=0.
COORDINATES: Set this parameter equal to the maximum number of coordinates needed in 
              user subroutine UEL at any node point of the element. 
            ABAQUS/Standard assigns space to store the coordinate values at all the nodes 
            associated with elements of this type. The default is COORDINATES=1.
VARIABLES: Set this parameter equal to the number of solution-dependent state variables 
           that must be stored within the element. 
           Its value must be greater than 0. The default is VARIABLES=1.
First line:

Enter the list of active degrees of freedom at the first node of the element 
(as determined by the connectivity list). The rule in “Conventions,” 
Section 1.2.2 of the ABAQUS Analysis User's Manual, 
regarding which degrees of freedom can be used for displacement, rotation, temperature, 
etc. must be conformed to.

Second line if the active degrees of freedom are different at subsequent nodes:

Enter the position in the connectivity list (node position on the element) where the new 
list of active degrees of freedom first applies.
Enter the new list of active degrees of freedom.

Repeat the second data line as often as necessary.

Degrees of freedom

Except for axisymmetric elements, the degrees of freedom are always referred to as follows:

1 x-displacement

2 y-displacement

3 z-displacement

4 Rotation about the x-axis, in radians

5 Rotation about the y-axis, in radians

6 Rotation about the z-axis, in radians

7 Warping amplitude (for open-section beam elements)

8 Pore pressure (or hydrostatic fluid pressure)

9 Electric potential

10 Not used

11 Temperature (or normalized concentration in mass diffusion analysis)

12 Second temperature (for shells or beams)

13 Third temperature (for shells or beams)

Required parameter:
ELSET: Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set containing the user 
elements for which these property values are being defined.

First line:

Enter the values of the element properties. Enter all floating point values first, followed immediately by the integer values.

Repeat this data line as often as necessary. Eight values per line are used for both real and integer values.
